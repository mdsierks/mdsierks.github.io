About me
======
Welcome! I am broadly interested in the processes that inform on weather and climate predictability. Currently, I am an [ASP Post-Doctoral Fellow](https://asp.ucar.edu/postdocs/postdoctoral-fellowship-program) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Multiscale Machine Learning In Coupled Earth System Modeling project ([M2lines](https://m2lines.github.io/)). I am working to examine regional climate model biases (via data assimilation increments) and build online corrections with modern machine learning methods.

I recently graduated from the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) where my dissertation focused on working to better understanding North American West Coast weather predictability with Deep Learning methods and the theoretical study of weather predictability at long time horizons. I am particularly interested in numerical weather prediction post-processing, and using large ensemble simulations to inform forecast windows of opportunity. Currently, I am working on schemes and methods to improve extreme weather event predictability at subseasonal timescales. My Ph.D. advisor team consisted of [Dr. Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), [Dr. Marty Ralph](https://mralph.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), and I am a team member at the [Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes](https://cw3e.ucsd.edu/).
