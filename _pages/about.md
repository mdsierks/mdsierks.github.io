## About
Hi! I'm Mike, a Ph.D. Candiate at the University of California, San Diego. Currently, I am in my final year of Climate Dynamics Ph.D. program at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/). I am part of the team at the [Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes](https://cw3e.ucsd.edu/) working with my advisor [Dr. Marty Ralph](https://mralph.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of extreme weather and the socio-economic impacts
of climate change. I am passionate about pursuing equitable solutions to risks posed by our changing climate in addition to  translating research into relevant scientific tools to empower informed decision making.

My dissertation focuses on evaluating the impacts of climate change on California's water resources. Currently, I am investigating the hydrological impacts of climate change on Californiaâ€™s largest reservoir, Lake Shasta. In this work, I am leveraging and developing novel statistical post-processing schemes to improve on current streamflow bias
correction methods for CMIP5 models. 
<!-- I have also studied synoptic drivers of extreme precipitation in the southwestern United States and their resulting impacts on the water resources of the region. Outside of my dissertation, I have pursued my interest in the intersection of science and policy through both through [awarded fellowships](https://gps.ucsd.edu/news-events/news/science-policy-fellows-use-research-to-help-shape-well-informed-policy-options.html) and [extracurricular activities](https://sioscipol.sioword.ucsd.edu/).
