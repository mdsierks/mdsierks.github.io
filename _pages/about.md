About me
======
Welcome! My research interests lie at the intersection of extreme weather and the socio-economic impacts
of climate change. I am also passionate about translating research to applications by way of providing relevant scientific tools to empower informed decision making. Currently, I am in my final year of PhD program at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego. My Ph.D. advisor is [Dr. Marty Ralph](https://mralph.scrippsprofiles.ucsd.edu/), and I am a team member at the [Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes](https://cw3e.ucsd.edu/). 

My dissertation focuses on evaluating the impacts of climate change on California's water resources. Currently, I am investigating the hydrological impacts of climate change on Californiaâ€™s largest reservoir, Lake Shasta. In this work, I am leveraging and developing novel statistical post-processing schemes to improve on current streamflow bias
correction methods for CMIP5 models.
