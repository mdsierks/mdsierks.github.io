## Simple Explanation of 4dvar Data Assimilation

With examples for data assimilation in logistic growth and Lorenz '63.
This tutorial is meant for graduate students struggling with the idea of 4dvar data assimiliation.
It walks through the math and concepts in simple models that are easily decomposed to show the intricacies. 
see [this notebook](https://github.com/WillyChap/Toy_DataAssimilation/blob/master/Adjoint%20Model%20for%20Data%20Assimilation%20.ipynb)

## Linear Inverse Modeling 

Code is based on the linear inverse model (LIM) described by Penland & Sardeshmukh (1995).
We walk through an instructive fabricated example and an example of prediction for tropical SSTs.
